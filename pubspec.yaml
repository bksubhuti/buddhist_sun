    - assets/sun.png
    - assets/moon.png
    - assets/moon_free.png

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
  - family: NotoSansMyanmar
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSansMyanmar-Regular.ttf
      - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSansSinhala-VariableFont_wdth,wght.ttf
